### Who does this site cater to?
- This site is catering to people who want to move forward with their life and career path by entering a SAIT program. The website gives information on all the classes taught and career paths after the course is completed.

### Call-to-Action critque
- I think the sites call-to-action is effective because 
1. Its big and right in the middle of the screen.
2. It uses an image of three people skiing in the mountains right outside of Calgary, which is a pretty big tourist attraction in Alberta.
3. Each person has a huge smile on their face which is inviting for people who would have to move in order to attend SAIT.
4. It features a big header saying "Your future career is waiting." in bold font that catches the eye of someone wanting to apply. 
5. There is a search bar used for navigating specific areas of the site, and a redirect link to browse all the programs SAIT has to offer. 
6. The site uses repetition by having multiple places throughout the page you can "browse all programs"
7. Lots of different colours around the call-to-action, then white space with text under it

Sait really wants the target audience to apply for a program by telling people their career choice is waiting for you after completing the program applied for.
